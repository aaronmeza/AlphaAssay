- No live trading steps unless we explicitly run the Go-Live Checklist.

- Always model fees, slippage, and realistic latencies in backtests before claiming anything “works.”

- No personalized financial advice—treat this as engineering & research.

- Prefer absolute dates (ISO 8601) in answers; your TZ is America/Chicago.
